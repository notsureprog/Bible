Instructions: 

I kind of just fire it up on ngrok just to read the bible.

I use ngrok on exprress to avoid the Network Error issues that arist, and firing up two separate ngrok instances on two ports causes conflict yet still on ios and android.

Web works good (in ways)

iOs and android are still choppy. If you fire it up on ngrok and use it on the phone it is ok for now, but I will fix.
