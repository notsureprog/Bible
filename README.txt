Save an API, so I hard code all 66 books of the bible (and apocrypha). This information never changes anyways

Still working on this. I kind of just threw it together in an attempt to use most - if not all - of React's built in hooks. I thought it would be a good idea to use all of them.

Will be memoizing soon and getting the drop down (I know one drop down that works, but I wanted to use bootstrap.)

no db for first push. I just want a simple bible. However, in the future, maybe highlighting and redux or something for highlighted verse management.
