- logout button - works on web, but maybe not ios. it does not on andrdoid
- work on highlighting verses.
- refactor
- test (find out why user.reducer.loading is undefined on login test, but idle on going to the page.) - the wrapper took care of it
- Error of undefined on bible screen when trying to manipulate the url and messing it up. (maybe get rid of deep linking if it isnt necessary) (maybe a drawer nav or whatever)
- merge github branches.
- sign and secure cookies


From the server, I will get the notinthedb message. no user is being pulled from mongo. All of that is good. However, on the login page, I do not get an error and It says i am logged in
